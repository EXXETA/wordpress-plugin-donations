- WordPress crons (= scheduled events) are set up and are running at least once a day.
- **Important:** WordPress should be able to send mails via `wp_mail`. If you are not sure about this,
e.g. check [this article](https://wphelp.de/wordpress-email) and test successful mail delivery.
- WooCommerce is (initially) set up
    - Currency: Euro


1. Be sure to meet the listed requirements for the web server and the WordPress installation, *before* you proceed.
2. Extract provided archive of this plugin to `wp-content/plugins` directory.
3. Install and activate this plugin in WordPress plugin management section.
4. Configure plugin settings in `Einstellungen > Spenden√ºbersicht`.
5. Add the banner to your *WooCommerce* cart page by using a block (in "Gutenberg" editor)
   or as an alternative you can use a WordPress shortcode (documented below).
   Technically both ways lead to the same markup/result.
6. Read this documentation carefully to understand how this plugin is supposed to work.
7. You'll get regular donation reports and you *must* transfer the donated money to the [WWF Germany](https://www.wwf.de/).
More information (including bank account) is given in the plugin's dashboard.

**NOTE:** After plugin installation/(re-)activation there will be generated one first (probably empty) report.
